# CSC325ClassProject

Welcome to Jeremy Smith's personal portfolio!

This project is meant to serve as an online portfolio to organize and showcase the programming expertise and experience that the student Jeremy Smith possesses.

## Meet the student

The website will contain a homepage to summarize Jeremy's background, interests, career goals, and other professional details. Additionally, an about me section will be
included to list more of the student's biography and academic record, as well as their resume in hopes of potential employers finding the page.

## Professional pages

These are where the bulk of the student's programming expertise will be reflected, and the main draw for potential employers and talent seekers.

### Projects
A compilation of the various projects Jeremy has worked on during his time as a student, whether it be class projects or personal projects. These will include whichever
ones the student is the proudest on, as well as a small README file for each one to detail what skills were used to complete it, and what the student learnt from it,
as well as why the student feels they're worthy of including in the website.

### Skills
A listing of the various skills the student has picked up during his degree, including but not limited to: programming languages, IDEs, operating systems, frameworks,
specific technologies, etc. It will also include any tools the student is proficient in, and a detailing of the student's level of expertise in each skill.
