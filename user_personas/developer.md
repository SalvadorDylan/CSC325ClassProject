> ### Scenario
> Craig is just one of two young developers fresh out of college, having gotten together to design a website for another student. While they're a small team and their project scope isn't that grand, they hope they can
> leverage their fresh and young perspective and ideas to create a website that pops out to potential employers - both for the website owner's sake, and for potential job opportunities for the pair from employers interested in the design of the website.
> Due to Craig's perfectionism, he is prone to spend a lot of extra hours ironing out small details or obsessing over minute additions or ideas, which may slow down the project. On the other hand, it also means
> he would serve as an excellent quality assurance person, making sure the website is up to par with his own expectations and ensuring the completion of the project.
