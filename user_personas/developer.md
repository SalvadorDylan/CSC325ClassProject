> ### Scenario
> Craig is just one of a handful of young developers fresh out of college, having gotten together to develop a planner and organization app to kickstart their careers
> after not having much luck with job offers. While they're a small time, they hope their fresh and young perspective on things helps make their project stand out
> among pre-existing apps. Motivated by the prospect of recognition and a stable job, they work hard day and night in the project, with Craig in particular
> spending various hours of his own free time to ensure his work is up to his own standards. While they find it difficult due to a lack of experience doing this,
> they also reach out to various contacts in the corporate world to ask for their feedback and input on how they view and utilize various organizational apps on the
> daily, using the knowledge gathered through interviews and surveys to direct their project into satisfying their various needs and wants.
> Due to Craig's nature as a developer, however, he grows rather attached to it and convinces the group to delay the launch for another month to satisfy his
> perfectionism, combing through every part of the project again to iron out any small flaws or details before finally launching the app on Google Play.
