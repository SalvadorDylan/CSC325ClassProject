> ### Scenario
> Jeremy has given this latest project of his onto a group of freshly graduated college students as a means to gauge their expertise and talent to become potential
> hirees of the company he works at. Due to their college grades and personal projects, he expects a lot out of them, and tries to not meddle too much in their
> workflow: he knows very well that he is stuck with old ideas and methodologies, and does not want them to influence the performance of the development team. Still,
> he sets strict deadlines for milestones of the project to ensure it is coming along nicely, and it takes a lot of convincing for him to allow the project's launch to
> be delayed by one month: ultimately, it is the team's passion for detail and perfectionism that sways him. Once it launches, he will be amongst the first to personally
> test the app, hoping it solves his personal needs as well.
