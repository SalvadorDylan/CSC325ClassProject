> ### Scenario
> Dorothy has been having punctuality issues for the past month related to business meetings and deadlines, given that her current planner and scheduling
> apps are either not up to par with her organizational needs or are too difficult and unintuitive to use, the latter of which leads to them being uninstalled
> in favor of new apps that will eventually be phased out as well. This eventually leads to reliance on older, cumbersome apps that she has been using for years
> and leave a lot to be desired.
> Our personal planner then comes in as the latest in a series of new app trials for her: thanks to it's very user friendly, easy-to-use GUI, she is able to quickly
> grasp how to utilize the planner to its fullest, while also providing her with ample options for configurating the program to her needs. This allows her to properly
> note down and program all of her meetings and deadlines with a variety of reminders and milestone-dates for projects of her, while also allowing her to plan out
> aspects of her personal time to maximize the spare time she has, using it to spend quality time with her family. Thus, she replaces her old apps with the new one,
> as it has finally met her needs.
