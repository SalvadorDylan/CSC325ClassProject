# Purpose
This directory will hold different user personas, representing people of interest to the project (major stakeholders).
It is provided so that the developer of the project can refer to them whenever they have a doubt on whether a decision
would appeal to whatever demographics they're trying to reach, or if it'd have a conflict with the wants/workflow of
another person of interest in the project.

### Developer persona
A persona made to represent the developer of the website, useful to a developer in case they're working in a team instead
of coding the site as a solo project, or to contemplate potential issues and benefits of having another coder join
the development team.

### End User pesona
A persona made to represent potential employers and hirers that stumble upon the website, useful to a developer in order
to keep the user's needs in mind when making changes to the project, and to know what to prioritize and what to cut.

### Owner persona
A persona made to represent the owner of the website: a student wishing to display his or her feats of programming
in hopes of being noticed by employers. Useful to a developer to remember the needs and expectations of the person
the website is being made for, and to never stop prioritizing them during development.
